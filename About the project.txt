About the project 

You have been appointed as the Lead Data Analyst to build a predictive model to determine if a building will have an insurance claim during a certain period or not. You will have to predict the probability of having at least one claim over the insured period of the building. The model will be based on the building characteristics. The target variable, Claim, is a:

1 if the building has at least a claim over the insured period.
0 if the building doesn’t have a claim over the insured period.

You have the data description and the training data too

Ensure you do all the necessary data preprocessing to improve your result, and evaluate too 

Also, your work should be added as a project to your GitHub repository. The link to the repository that has your notebook(s) is what is expected to be submitted.


A good project contains 
1. A good data cleaning and preprocessing 
2. ⁠A detailed and explained set of insights through Exploratory Data Analysis 
3. ⁠A well-experimented preprocessing for modelling 
4. ⁠Implement more than 1 model 
5. ⁠Evaluate the models
