# Insurance Claim Prediction Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **student machine learning project** focused on predicting whether an insurance customer is likely to make a claim based on given features.  
The project demonstrates the basic workflow of a data science project, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

This project was created as part of my learning journey in **Python, data analysis, and machine learning**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand and explore an insurance dataset  
- Clean and preprocess data  
- Train a machine learning model for prediction  
- Evaluate model performance  
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world datasets  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning algorithms  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – analysis and experimentation

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Handle missing values and preprocess data  
3. Encode categorical variables  
4. Split data into training and testing sets  
5. Train a machine learning model  
6. Evaluate model performance

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/insurance-claim-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd insurance-claim-prediction
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Run the notebook cells step by step.

## 📊 Results
The model predicts whether an insurance customer is likely to file a claim.  
This project prioritizes **learning and understanding** rather than production-level accuracy.

## 📚 What I Learned
- Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques  
- Feature encoding and model training  
- Model evaluation and interpretation  
- Proper project documentation using GitHub
